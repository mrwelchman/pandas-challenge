Pandas is a great library written for the Python language that is used for data manipulation and analysis. It's great for reading data and a number of methods of analysis such as merging, reshaping, or selectiong data. It also makes cleaning and sorting data a breeze.

#### Heroes of Pymoli

Imagine if you will, a world in which I am the Lead Analyst for your small independent developer. Picture the cool office space with some pop art on the walls and maybe a bar. It's a happening joint, and it's all paid for by our newest free-to-play but chalk-full-of-microtransactions outing, the Heroes of Pymoli. After a fruitless argument about changing that ridiculous name, in your mind's eye see yourself tasking me with analyzing our purchasing data.
